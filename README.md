Project Motivation:
As a data analyst, I’m passionate about eco-friendly fashion because it offers a powerful intersection of data-driven insight and meaningful environmental impact. The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to global waste and carbon emissions, and sustainable practices are essential to reversing that trend. By analyzing patterns in materials, production methods, and consumer behavior, I can help identify what truly drives sustainable change and guide brands toward more responsible decisions. Using data to make fashion not only smarter but also greener is both a professional challenge and a personal mission.
